This website uses the camera to record an energy meter box and its blinking lights. It processes the image
locally and timestamps each red blink, then sends it to a firebase realtime database.

This website is part of a larger project to expose an API with more detailed energy consumption granularity
by using a camera instead of a live monitoring attatchment for the energy meter.
