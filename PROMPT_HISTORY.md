Initialize a nuxt project in the camera directory. Ensure unit tests with coverage reporting, integration
tests with playwright and formatting and linting with biomejs is set up and able to run through mise tasks.
Use typescript, Nuxt UI library, tailwindcss 4 (ALWAYS look up documentation for tailwindcss, because they
recently changed a lot), and vueuse. For now the goal is just to ensure you can run these tools and that
they all work. You MUST use online documentation extensively to ensure compatibility with latest versions.
