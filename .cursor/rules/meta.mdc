- Keep an updated "AI Notes" section in AGENTS.md, sort of like a sitemap.xml for websites, just for architecture, system design and logic in the project.
- Use models with larger contexts when creating or editing features.
- Use very intelligent models with reasoning for creating tests.
- Use faster, cheaper and smaller for bug fixing.
