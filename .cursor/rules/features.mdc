- Identify dependencies and blocking tasks before implementing a feature.
- Use existing interfaces where possible.
- Use existing popular libraries if it makes code more readable.
- Avoid tight coupling; prefer modularity.
- Add useful debug logger statements that display important property values.
- Always create an integration test after implementing a full feature.
- After finishing the feature, go over the code again to remove redundant code and improve readability.
